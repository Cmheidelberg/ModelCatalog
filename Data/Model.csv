PIHM,PIHM,pihm_2.2,The Penn State Integrated Hydrology Model (PIHM) is a multiprocess multi-scale hydrologic model where the major processes are fully coupled using the semi-discrete finite volume method,Hydrology,PIHM uses a finite volume numerical proceedure that resolves the domain into triangular prisms from bottom of groundwater to top of canopy.The state variables within each prism are fully coupled internally and with adjacent cells such that a mass balance is assured at each cell and globally across the domain.,http://www.pihm.psu.edu,https://w3id.org/okn/o/sdm#Theory-GuidedModel,,,,,,,,,,,https://publisher.mint.isi.edu/VPDku/Animation_Flood.gif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pihmGrid
CYCLES,Cycles,cycles_0.8.0_alpha,Cycles simulates the productivity and the water-carbon and nitrogen balance of soil-crop systems subject to climate conditions and a large array of management constraints,Agriculture,The simulation unit in Cycles is a field with a single soil (soil file) that is layered (user defined number of layers) exposed to a daily weather (weather file) and subject to operations (operations file) that control soil properties; vegetation properties (crop file) and surface residue properties. Variables in weather file are considered rigid forcings. Surface conditions do not alter air temperature or moisture. Soil is connected to the residues; aboveground living biomass; air; and radiation from the atmosphere; and with the bottom of the profile. There is no lateral water or solutes movement within the soil profile. When running stand alone; runoff and percolation water simply leaves the simulation unit. Vegetation can be composed of monocultures (single species) or multiple species. The parameters describing each plant of the community are described in the crop file. The operations file allows multiple types of interventions organized as tillage; fertilization; and planting events. Operations like kill crop are part of tillage. To enable coupling with other models; Cycles can be set to replace (re-initialize) internally calculated variable with external inputs. For example; infiltration can be an input from the PIHM model; soil moisture can be reset based on observations or data from other models. This flexibility extends to all state variables. Re-initialization algorithm can break the mass balance and is not recommended unless the goal override mass or energy balance concerns.,https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/labs/kemanian/models-and-tools/cycles,https://w3id.org/okn/o/sdm#Theory-GuidedModel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ECONOMIC_AGGREGATE_CROP_SUPPLY,Aggregate crop supply response model,EACS_2.0,The EACS describes the aggregate crop supply response model for the country of South Sudan,Economic,This is a regional-scale aggregate model of agricultural supply for a specified set of crops (cassava; groundnuts; maize; sesame seed; and sorghum). The model calibrates the parameters of a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function and linear cost function using the positive mathematical programming (PMP) method. Calibration relies on observed data on agricultural input use (land and fertilizer) and crop yields.
